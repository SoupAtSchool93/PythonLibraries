# What is this?
Python Libraries I make, only shared to my teacher, but may be shared to a friend.

# [Soup Library](soupLib.py) 0.0.4 ([Info Document](SoupLib_Info.md))
The first library i've made, so far pretty simple and only works for .py programs that are in the same directory as it.
This library also only currently supports Python programs that rely primarily on the terminal (.py)
can also can do basic file operations like finding files or directorys within a directory
