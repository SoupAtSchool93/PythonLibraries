- clearScreen() needs no parameters and will clear the screen when running in a terminal. If running in a non-terminal environment, will instead do nothing.
- userInput() takes a question as a parameter and will return the user answer
- colorScreen() accepts a set of colors, the first one is the text, the second is the backround, also only works in a terminal like clearScreen()
